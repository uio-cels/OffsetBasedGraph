**Note**: This is Offsetbasedgraph version 1.0.7, released with the paper *Coordinates and Intervals in Graph-based Reference Genomes* and supports the analysis done in the paper. There is now a newer stripped-down version of Offsetbasedgraph, [version *2.0.0*](https://github.com/uio-cels/OffsetBasedGraph/tree/v2.0) that is *not* compatible with the analysis performed in this paper, but instead created to be compatible with [Graph Peak Caller](https://github.com/uio-bmi/graph_peak_caller). 
`pip install offsetbasedgraph` will install the newest version. `pip install offsetbasedgraph==1.0.7` will install the paper-version and is also available in the v2.0 branch.
